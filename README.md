# Task-Management-System
- Created a RESTful API using Spring Boot for managing tasks.

- Implemented endpoints for CRUD operations for tasks.

- Used appropriate HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) and status codes.

- Included validation for input data & handled potential errors gracefully.

- Database Integration: Used a relational database (such as MySQL) to store task information.

- Designed and implemented the necessary tables and relationships for storing tasks.

- Connected the backend API to the database to perform CRUD operations.
